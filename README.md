# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org)
- PHP and Composer (https://getcomposer.org/)
- MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

#### Setting up the API Backend

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already done so):

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:gudofabi/bulleting-board-app.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Set up the API environment**:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/api
   cp .env.dev .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to set up your MySQL database credentials.

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Run database migrations and seeders**:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

5. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   This will start the local development server at http://localhost:8000.

#### Setting up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/frontend
   ```

2. **Set up the frontend environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Modify the `.env` file as needed to match your local or development environment settings.

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command will start the frontend development server, typically available at http://localhost:3000.
